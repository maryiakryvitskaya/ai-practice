## Home Practice & ChatGPT for Everyone

> Experiment with the AI tools discussed today (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini) and apply prompt engineering techniques in your daily work.  
> Document your experience and any challenges or insights you gain.

I used **ChatGPT GPT-4o** extensively in this homework, both for code generation and reasoning about performance and UX issues.

## Insights & Reflections

### Prompt Engineering Techniques Used:

- Iterative prompting: started simple, refined prompts as I went.
- Role prompting: asked ChatGPT to act as a **senior Angular developer** or **frontend performance expert**.
- Used structured prompts for PR messages and commit messages.
- Asked for code with explanations to understand the reasoning.

### Challenges:

- Managing unit conversion for metrics (e.g., TBT in ms vs ns).
- Getting stable responsive behavior at exact breakpoints.
- Proper use of Web Worker API within Angular 17 (module worker syntax).

### Insights:

- ChatGPT is very helpful for **boilerplate code**, performance optimizations, and PR/commit writing.
- Prompt engineering makes a big difference: clear prompts â†’ better results.
- Itâ€™s important to combine AI suggestions with my own judgment and testing.
